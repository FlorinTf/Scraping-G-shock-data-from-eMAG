# Scraping-G-shock-data-from-eMAG
The Python script searches through all the G-Shock items and where it finds details it extracts them together with the price and stores them in a csv file. So that the data can be analyzed later.
There is also the possibility to select a price range. But in order to have a larger database I did not select a price range.
